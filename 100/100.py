# IDEA
# Trees are identical if they have the same structure and the same node values at each position.
# We can use the recursive function to check if the trees are identical.
# if in any node the values are different, we can return False
# if we reach the end of the tree, we can return True
# TIME COMPLEXITY
# O(n) because we need to visit every node in the tree
# SPACE COMPLEXITY
# O(n) because of the recursion stack
