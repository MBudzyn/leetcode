# IDEA
# we can solve this problem by iterating through the tree using stack (BFS)
# and depending on actual case we will add the lvl in normal order or reversed
# The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
# The space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
