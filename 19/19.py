# IDEA
# we can solve this problem by using two pointers,
# one pointer will by in 0 position, and the other we will move two n position
# then we will move two pointers at the same time, until the second pointer reaches the end
# then we will remove the node that is the next node of the first pointer
# TIME COMPLEXITY
# O(N) because we iterate through the list
# SPACE COMPLEXITY
# O(1) because we don't use any extra space
