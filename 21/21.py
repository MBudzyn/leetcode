# IDEA
# we will iterate through the both lists and compare the first elements
# then to the result we will add the smaller one and delete it from the list
# at the end we will add the rest of the non-empty list
# TIME COMPLEXITY
# O(N) because we iterate through the lists
# SPACE COMPLEXITY
# O(N) because we use stack to store the elements
