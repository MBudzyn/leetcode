# IDEA
# we can solve this problem by simply deleting the duplicates
# iterating through the list from the second element to the end
# if the current element is equal to the previous element, we delete it
# we return the length of the list after deleting the duplicates
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
