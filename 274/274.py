# IDEA
# becouse of the definition of h-index first idea that comes to mind is to sort the array and then iterate through it
# and check if the current element is greater than the number of elements that are greater than it
# if so we can actualize the cd result and return it at the end if we didn't fing greater h-index
# TIME COMPLEXITY
# The time complexity is O(nlogn) because we need to sort the array
# SPACE COMPLEXITY
# The space complexity is O(1) because we only need to use constant number of variables
