# IDEA
# to check if the sudoku is valid we need to check all rows, columns and 3x3 squares
# and return False if we find any duplicates or True if we don't
# To apply this idea we will create three helper functions to get rows, columns and 3x3 squares
# then we will iterate through all of them and check if there are any duplicates
# TIME COMPLEXITY
# The time complexity is O(1) because the board is always 9x9
# SPACE COMPLEXITY
# The space complexity is O(1) because we only need to use constant number of variables
