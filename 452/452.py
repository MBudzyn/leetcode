# IDEA
# we can solve this problem by using greedy algorithm
# we iterate through the list from the second element to the end
# if the current element[0] is > then previous tmp, we add 1 to the result
# else we update the previous tmp[1] to the min(tmp, element[1])
# COMPLEXITY
# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(1)
