# IDEA
# we can solve this problem by using greedy algorithm
# we will iterate through the array and for each position we will calculate
# the max size of jump we can make from that position in the array
# as the max from the current position and the previous max - 1
# then if we can reach the end of the array, we will return True
# in other case we will return False
# TIME COMPLEXITY
# O(N) because we iterate through the array
# SPACE COMPLEXITY
