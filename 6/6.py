# IDEA
# to solve this problem, we can create 2D array that on each lvl will store
# the letters of the layer of the zigzag pattern of the string
# then we will iterate through the word and by changing direction we will by
# adding the letters to the array on the correct level
# then we will iterate through the array and concatenate the letters
# TIME COMPLEXITY
# O(N) because we iterate through the word
# SPACE COMPLEXITY
# O(N) because we store the letters in the 2D array
