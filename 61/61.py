# IDEA
# in first iteration, we need to count number of elements in the linked list
# ten we need to actualize the value of k to k % n (n is the number of elements in the linked list)
# then we need to find the element that is n - k - 1, and correctly merge two parts of the linked list
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
