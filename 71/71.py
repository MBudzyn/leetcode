# IDEA
# we can solve this problem by implementing stack as array
# first put the all non-Null elements to the stack
# then delete all single "." symbols and iterate through the stack
# by deleting the last element if the element is equal to ".."
# TIME COMPLEXITY
# O(N) because we iterate through the string
# SPACE COMPLEXITY
# O(N) because we use stack to store the elements
