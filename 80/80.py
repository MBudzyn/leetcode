# IDEA
# because we can store whatever we want at the end of the array,
# we will be simply skipping the elements that have more than 2 occurrences
# and rest of the elements will be moved to the left of the array, on
# the first skipped place, then we will actualize the index to move the elements
# to the left of the array, and we will return the index of the last "to_insert"
