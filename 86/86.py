# IDEA
# we will partition the linked list into two parts, one that will store
# elements less than x and the other that will store elements greater
# or equal to x. We will then merge the two lists to get the desired output
# TIME COMPLEXITY
# The time complexity is O(n) as we are iterating through the list only once
# SPACE COMPLEXITY
# The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space
