# LeetCode Solutions Repository
## Repository Overview
This repository contains my solutions to problems from the LeetCode platform. Each problem is categorized by topic, with topics organized in folders such as Arrays, Binary Trees, Dictionaries, etc.
Each individual problem has its own subfolder, named after the problem's unique LeetCode ID. 
This structure is intended to improve organization and make it easier to navigate and review solutions based on problem categories.

## Folder Structure
Each problem folder follows a specific structure:

- **Topic** *(e.g., Arrays, Binary Trees)*
  - **Problem_Number** *(folder for each problem, named by its LeetCode ID)*
    - `Problem_Number.py` - Solution with solving idea
    - `descriptionProblem_Number.png` - Problem description screenshot
    - `resultProblem_Number.png` - Complexity results screenshot


## File Descriptions
Problem_Number.py: Contains the solution to the problem. Each solution file includes comments explaining the main idea, logic, and approach used to solve the problem.
descriptionProblem_Number.png: A screenshot capturing the problem's description from LeetCode for reference.
resultProblem_Number.png: A screenshot showing the time and memory performance results from LeetCode for this solution.
## Topics
This repository is organized by the following topics, with each folder containing relevant problems:

- `Array and String`
- `Binary Tree BFS`
- `Hashmap`
- `Binary Tree General`
- `Linked List`
- `Matrix`
- `Intervals`
- `Sliding Window`
- `Stack`
- `Two Pointers`


## Status
This repository is a work in progress and serves as an ongoing space for regular practice and skill improvement.
New solutions will be added continuously as I tackle additional problems on LeetCode.
