# 🧮 LeetCode Solutions Repository  

This repository contains my personal collection of **algorithmic problem solutions** from the **LeetCode** platform.  
Solving algorithmic challenges has always been an enjoyable way for me to **improve problem-solving skills**, explore new ideas, and stay sharp in computer science fundamentals.

## 🧭 Overview  

Each solution is carefully organized by **topic** (e.g., Arrays, Binary Trees, Hashmaps), and each problem is stored in its own folder named after its unique LeetCode ID.  
The structure is designed for clarity and easy navigation — allowing quick access to specific problems or categories.
