# IDEA
# we can handle only one stock at a time, but we can sell it the same day we buy it
# we want to sell stock always when we can make a profit and actualize stock we handle
# buy one we are buying or actualizing stock we handle with the lowest price we can
# TIME COMPLEXITY
# the time complexity is O(n) because we only need to iterate the array once
# SPACE COMPLEXITY
# the space complexity is O(1)
