# IDEA
# We can use two pointers to solve this problem
# We need to set two pointers, one on the left and one on the right of the array
# Then we can calculate the area between those two pointers and actualize the maximum area
# Then we can move the pointer with the smaller height to the right or left depending on the height
# and actualize the maximum area if the new area is greater than the biggest one
# TIME COMPLEXITY
# The time complexity is O(n) because we only need to iterate the array once
# SPACE COMPLEXITY
# The space complexity is O(1) because we only need to use two pointers to solve this problem
# and constant number of variables
